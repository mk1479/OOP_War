War is traditionally a two player game of chance. 
In our game of war, we allow a maximum of 4 players and our code does the proccessing of the game. The game removes players who have no cards left and display the winner, who is the player left with all 52 cards.  

Our game will do the following:
The game will allow the players to enter up to four names. The game will then assign a suit, color and value to each card. The game will shuffle the cards and assign an equal amount to each player. The game will the begin rounds of displaying the card values and reassign the cards to the player with the card of highest value. If a player has 0 cards, they will be removed from the game. The game will continue until one player is left with all 52 cards. The game will then display the winner. 

In order to play our game, the players will have to do the following:

1) Ensure that "/Users/henryschmeding/Desktop/deck.csv" is a working filepath. "deck.csv" is included on the Github repository. Ensure that the file is on the user "henryschmeding"'s desktop.
2) Run the "War.java" class. 
3) Follow the console instructions.

NOTE: Due to the nature of the card game "War", it is possible that a game will seem to go on indefinitely. The program will prompt the user each round if the user would like to quit to avoid a long game.
